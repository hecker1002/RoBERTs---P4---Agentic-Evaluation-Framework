# PROJECT FLOW 

1. Built the privat repo online ,cloned and started working on the Project . 


# PROBLEM 1 
# Preparation of Dataset 

-> Make our own data using (manual labelling + llm based labelling ) 
( Dataset made  by - making 3 llm behave with diff eprson(carefree , serious etc ) and label their repsose by a human help )
( had to do it in abtch as Ai limit reached )

-> make the regex componet that removes the Most basic nuances nosies and also catches the msot obvious lexicla apttern 
b/w ( prompt) and (resposne) simialrity 



-> make the BERT ( promp ,resposne ,regex labels in single featuresentecne ) and fien tue on labeeld datset with ( hall + info accuarcy score )


# thsi is Only the evaluaitor aprt , NOT the actual aprt of pipleine 
-> LLm -ai judge to take all these ( prompt ,respose , regex , hall score ) and then check factual ifno 
and (recheck pre  info for cross-ceckig and also gives a finals core for full pipeline )


# and afte this we explroe More ideas to make this pipelien unique from other teams . 



-- finalyl deploy it online 


For explainalbity we need  the LLmas ai judge to that sue labels from BERT (in turn usign featrie from regex+mini lm simply) 
that  


BERT --> gives what is the score" base don repsose nature 

But to reaosn WHy this occured abse on all quesn , reposne ,scores ,bert predictions ,etc ,it reasons "WHY"


## Shortcomign of our Project 

Our project is somwhat weak on Summarization ....( as prompt we designed were nOT too logn anf fir for Summarozation Task) 
and the reposne were restricted in the Length of ( 20 , 60 words) ONLY .
