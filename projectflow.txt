# PROJECT FLOW 

1. Built the privat repo online ,cloned and started working on the Project . 


# PROBLEM 1 
# Preparation of Dataset 

-> Make our own data using (manual labelling + llm based labelling ) 
( Dataset made  by - making 3 llm behave with diff eprson(carefree , serious etc ) and label their repsose by a human help )
( had to do it in abtch as Ai limit reached )

-> make the regex componet that removes the Most basic nuances nosies and also catches the msot obvious lexicla apttern 
b/w ( prompt) and (resposne) simialrity 



-> make the BERT ( promp ,resposne ,regex labels in single featuresentecne ) and fien tue on labeeld datset with ( hall + info accuarcy score )


# thsi is Only the evaluaitor aprt , NOT the actual aprt of pipleine 
-> LLm -ai judge to take all these ( prompt ,respose , regex , hall score ) and then check factual ifno 
and (recheck pre  info for cross-ceckig and also gives a finals core for full pipeline )


# and afte this we explroe More ideas to make this pipelien unique from other teams .
